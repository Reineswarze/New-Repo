### What subclasses can I choose from?
Your subclasses are double saber, dual blades/soaring blades, and wand. 
(It’s a joke, successor clases don’t take subclasses you silly goose.)

### What should I affix?
MELEE, with some MELEE, and more MELEE on the safe side for more damage. 200 or more pp for wand. 1.3k hp is fine for most things. 
1.6k for living through any mistake/boss that's not lv999

If you’re still questioning why melee > tech 
Galvus tests each type of affix on the following [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcBizzAX30)

### Is Etoile stronger or weaker than Hero or Phantom?
Your performance with the class will ultimately depend on you, even if another class is stronger or weaker.

### What Mag should I use?
Any lv 200 attack stat mag will work for Etoile

### What trigger action should I use?
PP restore K (tech mag evolution path), status cleanse/recovery B since not anti (Photon Booster shop)

### What SP action should I use?
Dance. Slight damage and boosts melee damage per hit

What Auto action should I use?
Megid or Grants. It deals the most damage and can poison (% hp damage) while grants will not miss. 
E.g. It dealt 36k dmg at lv 80 Et with a mag excitement ring without a wand in equipped.

### How to Move Fast as an Etoile?
Quasar part 1, radiant sting, and prism circular are good for travelling. 
Quasar and sting are currently the fastest amongst the etoile weapons but eats a lot of PP over long distance travelling. 
Prism circular is more pp efficient for long distance travelling but slower.
Gunblade regenschlag/kick dance dash is most efficient but has hitstop

if you are on the Japanese servers, you have the option of using the helen bathina katana which allows for the use of asagiri rendan.

### Can I Main One Weapon?
You can but wand is near the stage of Must-Have, having no DBs or DS is fine.
